
For this Toll_Tax Design:
Design Pattern: MVC (Model view and Controller)
IDE : IntelliJ Idea
Coding Language : Java (20)

Here I did Low-Level design of Toll_Tax_Service System by using MVC pattern.

In Model i created 15 classes as per Requirement:
1)Bill
2)LeaderBoard
3)Toll
4)Toll_Firm
5)Toll_booths
6)Pass_type --> a) Single pass  b)Return pass  c) Weekly Pass
7)Pass_Status --> a) Valid     b)Expired
8)Vehicle
9)Vehicle_Type
10)Two_wheeler
11)Four_wheeler

Little issue I'm facing here in LeaderBoardService Class.
